                    <p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ower is rarely distributed evenly. Across social, political, and technological systems, power tends to concentrate where awareness is greater—where patterns are seen earlier, consequences anticipated more clearly, and narratives shaped more effectively. This asymmetry creates both capability and risk.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">Power, in this sense, is informational before it is institutional.</span></span></p>

                <section id="asymmetry">
                    <h2>Awareness as Power Asymmetry</h2>
                    <p>When one individual or group perceives systems, incentives, or feedback loops that others do not, a power differential emerges. This differential does not require malice to exist; it arises naturally from unequal access to understanding.</p>

                    <p>In modern contexts—finance, media, technology, governance—such asymmetries are amplified by scale. Small differences in awareness can produce large downstream effects.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">Awareness asymmetry precedes economic, legal, and political leverage.</span></span></p>

                <section id="responsibility-scaling">
                    <h2>Responsibility Scales with Awareness</h2>
                    <p>If awareness expands the range of foreseeable outcomes, responsibility expands with it. This scaling is not moralistic; it is structural. A system capable of anticipating harm carries responsibility for mitigating it.</p>

                    <p>This principle reframes ethical accountability: responsibility is not assigned retroactively by authority, but emerges prospectively from perception.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Low awareness:</strong> limited responsibility due to constrained foresight.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate awareness:</strong> responsibility within known domains.</li>
                        <li><strong>High awareness:</strong> responsibility for systemic and indirect effects.</li>
                    </ul>

                <!-- NEW SECTION: Abuse Case -->
                <section id="abuse-case">
                    <h2>When "Greater Awareness" Becomes Justification</h2>
                    <p>There is a failure mode this framework must acknowledge: the claim of superior awareness can itself become a tool of domination. History is full of examples where those in power justified control by asserting they "understood better" than those they governed.</p>

                    <p>This is the shadow side of responsibility scaling. If "I see more, therefore I bear more responsibility" is valid, it is a short step to "I see more, therefore I should decide for you." The first is a burden; the second is paternalism dressed as virtue.</p>

                    <p>The distinction matters: responsibility scaling is about <em>accountability</em>, not <em>authority</em>. Greater awareness means you are more answerable for outcomes, not that you are entitled to determine them for others. The person who sees the avalanche coming bears responsibility to warn—not to decide who gets to leave the mountain.</p>

                    <p>Any framework that links awareness to responsibility must also include structural checks against this slippage. Transparency, consent, distributed power, and the ability to challenge claims of superior insight are not opposed to responsibility scaling—they are essential to it.</p>

                <section id="failure-modes">
                    <h2>When Power Outpaces Integration</h2>
                    <p>Ethical failure often occurs not because awareness is absent, but because it is insufficiently integrated. When cognition outpaces embodiment, emotion, or empathy, power becomes extractive rather than generative.</p>

                <section id="restraint">
                    <h2>Restraint as an Expression of Power</h2>
                    <p>In systems with unequal awareness, restraint becomes a primary ethical signal. Choosing not to act on every advantage is often more stabilizing than exercising maximum leverage.</p>

                    <p>This reframes restraint not as weakness, but as evidence of integration: awareness coordinated with empathy and long-term perspective.</p>

                <section id="compassion">
                    <h2>Compassion as a Power Regulator</h2>
                    <p>Compassion functions as a regulatory mechanism in awareness-driven systems. It prevents isolation, mitigates hierarchy, and allows individuals operating at different points on the awareness spectrum to coexist without coercion.</p>

                    <p>Without compassion, awareness stratifies; with it, awareness diffuses.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="collective">
                    <h2>Collective Implications</h2>
                    <p>Societies that reward awareness without cultivating responsibility risk systemic instability. Conversely, cultures that integrate awareness, responsibility, and restraint tend to produce more resilient institutions.</p>

                    <p>The ethical challenge of advanced cognition is therefore not how much power can be gained, but how consciously it can be held.</p>
