                    <h2>Awareness as the Precondition for Choice</h2>

                    <p>The <a href="awareness-as-a-spectrum-not-a-switch.html">spectrum model of awareness</a> suggests that freedom is not binary but graded. We are more free in domains where we can perceive options, anticipate consequences, and act from deliberation rather than reflex. Conversely, we are less free—mechanically, not morally—in domains where our awareness is truncated.</p>

                    <p>This has an uncomfortable corollary: if someone else controls what you can perceive, they control the boundaries of your freedom. Not through force, but through <a href="../definitions.html#epistemic-divergence" class="definition-link" data-term="Epistemic Divergence" data-definition="When realities drift because people receive different inputs and interpret them under different incentives.">epistemic architecture</a>.</p>

                    <p>A person cannot choose an option they cannot see. A society cannot deliberate on a question it does not know to ask. When fundamental information is withheld, the downstream decisions are not "free" in any robust sense—they are constrained by an invisible boundary that the decision-maker cannot even push against, because they do not know it exists.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">This is distinct from ordinary ignorance. We are all ignorant of many things. But ordinary ignorance is not <em>administered</em>.</span></span></p>

                    <h2>The Custodial Capture of Agency</h2>

                    <p><a href="custodial-secrecy-and-the-locked-away-angel.html">Custodial secrecy</a> does not frame itself as theft. It frames itself as stewardship: <em>we hold this so that you don't have to bear it</em>. The framing is not always cynical. Genuine belief in protective necessity is common among those who classify.</p>

                    <p>But the effect is the same regardless of intent. When a custodial class withholds information that would change how people allocate resources, assess risks, or understand their place in the cosmos, they have not merely kept a secret. They have <em>captured</em> a portion of collective agency and hold it in indefinite escrow.</p>

                    <details class="collapse">
                        <summary>The escrow metaphor</summary>
                        <div class="collapse-content">
                            <p>In legal escrow, an asset is held by a third party until conditions are met. The asset still belongs to someone; it is merely inaccessible. Custodial secrecy operates similarly: the freedom to make fully-informed decisions <em>belongs</em> to the public, but is held by institutions that set the release conditions—conditions that, conveniently, never quite arrive.</p>
                            <p>The difference is that in legal escrow, both parties know the asset exists. In epistemic escrow, the depositors do not know what has been taken from them.</p>
                        </div>
                    </details>

                    <p>This is why <a href="../definitions.html#interpretive-capture" class="definition-link" data-term="Interpretive Capture" data-definition="When an institution monopolizes meaning-making about uncertain phenomena.">Interpretive Capture</a> matters. It is not enough to control facts; one must control the frameworks through which facts become meaningful. A custodial regime that permits only certain questions to be asked has shaped the outcome before any answer is given.</p>

                <section id="responsibility-inversion">
                    <h2>The Responsibility Inversion</h2>

                    <p>If <a href="awareness-responsibility-and-power.html">responsibility scales with awareness</a>, then those who know more bear more. This is not a moral punishment; it is a structural consequence. The person who sees the avalanche coming and says nothing is implicated in a way that the person who never looked up the mountain is not.</p>

                    <p>Apply this to custodial secrecy. Suppose a government program possesses evidence that would reframe humanity's understanding of its situation—evidence bearing on existential risk, energy scarcity, or the nature of intelligence itself. Every policy decision made in ignorance of that evidence is partially authored by those who withheld it.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">This does not require the custodians to have caused the ignorance. It only requires that they could have relieved it and chose not to.</span></span></p>

                    <p>The custodians may believe they are protecting the public from destabilizing knowledge. But protection and control are not the same thing, and the conflation serves the protector's interests more than the protected's.</p>

                    <p>Here is the inversion: the custodial class, by virtue of their awareness, becomes responsible not only for what they do with the knowledge, but for everything the public does <em>without</em> it. They have, in effect, co-signed every decision made under conditions they engineered.</p>

                    <h2>The Collapse of the Epistemic Commons</h2>

                    <p>A functioning <a href="../definitions.html#epistemic-commons" class="definition-link" data-term="Epistemic Commons" data-definition="A shared substrate of facts that a community treats as mutually legible.">Epistemic Commons</a> requires that participants share access to foundational evidence—not agreement on interpretation, but agreement on what is available to interpret. When custodial regimes withdraw fundamental facts from circulation, the commons does not merely shrink. It <em>fractures</em>.</p>

                    <p>Those inside the classification boundary operate with one reality. Those outside operate with another. The two groups can no longer reason together, because they are no longer reasoning from the same premises. This is <a href="../definitions.html#epistemic-divergence" class="definition-link" data-term="Epistemic Divergence" data-definition="When realities drift because people receive different inputs and interpret them under different incentives.">Epistemic Divergence</a> by design rather than accident.</p>

                    <p>The public senses the fracture without being able to name it. Trust erodes. Conspiracy theories proliferate—not because people are irrational, but because they are pattern-matching on real signals: something is being withheld, the official story has gaps, and the institutions demanding trust have not earned it.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">Conspiracy theories are often wrong in their specifics but right in their structure: they detect institutional dishonesty even when they misidentify its content.</span></span></p>

                <section id="tragedy">
                    <h2>The Tragedy of the Custodians</h2>

                    <p>It would be convenient if the custodial class were villains. Villains can be opposed, replaced, defeated. But the more accurate picture is tragic.</p>

                    <p>The custodians are themselves trapped. They possess awareness that isolates them. They see the stakes but are bound by institutional logic, classification law, and career incentives that make disclosure personally catastrophic. Their heightened awareness does not make them more free; it makes them <em>more burdened</em>—aware of consequences they cannot discuss, responsible for outcomes they cannot influence, and unable to share the weight with those who might help carry it.</p>

                    <p>This is the dark complement to the <a href="meta-cognition-and-freedom.html">awareness-freedom thesis</a>. Awareness expands agency only when it can be acted upon. Awareness that cannot be discharged through action becomes a prison. The custodians are not the most free among us; they may be the least free—locked in a <a href="../definitions.html#reality-lens" class="definition-link" data-term="Reality Lens" data-definition="The implicit filter through which a person forms beliefs: sources, incentives, social group, and ranking systems.">reality lens</a> they cannot share and cannot escape.</p>

                            <p>This framing does not excuse the harm caused by secrecy. It contextualizes it. Many within classified programs likely experience genuine moral distress. They are not sociopaths hoarding power; they are people caught in a structure that predates them and will outlast them.</p>
                            <p>Understanding this matters because sustainable disclosure—if it ever occurs—will require these individuals to act against institutional gravity. That is easier if they are met with understanding rather than vilification. The goal is to change the structure, not to punish its inheritors.</p>

                    <h2>Implications</h2>

                    <p>If the foregoing is correct, several things follow:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Freedom audits should include epistemic access.</strong> A society that measures freedom only by legal permissions misses the deeper constraint: what are people <em>allowed to know</em> when making the choices the law permits?</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsibility attribution must account for information asymmetry.</strong> When decisions go wrong, we should ask not only who decided, but who controlled what the deciders could see.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disclosure is not a gift; it is a debt.</strong> If freedom was borrowed through secrecy, disclosure is repayment—not generosity, but justice delayed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Custodial reform requires structural change, not just personnel change.</strong> Replacing custodians does not fix a system that produces custodial capture. The classification architecture itself must be redesigned with bounded secrecy, sunset clauses, and external audit.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Coda</h2>

                    <p>None of this requires believing any particular secret exists. It requires only accepting two premises: that awareness is the precondition for meaningful choice, and that some institutions systematically restrict awareness of matters that would change collective choices.</p>

                    <p>From those premises, the rest follows. Asymmetric awareness produces asymmetric freedom. Asymmetric freedom produces asymmetric responsibility. And those who hold the asymmetry—whether or not they chose to, whether or not they want to—are accountable for what is done in the dark they maintain.</p>

                    <p>The weight of knowing is not the knowledge itself. It is everything that others cannot do because they do not know.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">This is why the heaviest secrets are not the most dangerous, but the most <em>consequential</em>—the ones that would change the most decisions if released.</span></span></p>
