  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>reedom is often framed as the ability to act without restriction. Contemporary models of cognition suggest a more precise formulation: freedom increases as a system gains the capacity to observe and regulate its own internal processes. Meta-cognition—the awareness of awareness—does not remove constraint, but it makes constraint visible.</p>

  <span class="sidenote">
    <span class="sidenote-number"></span>
    <span class="sidenote-content">This reframing shifts freedom from a metaphysical absolute to a functional capacity.</span>
  </span>
</section>

<section id="awareness-and-choice">
  <h2>Awareness as a Precondition for Choice</h2>
  <p>Behavior that arises without awareness is not chosen in any meaningful sense; it is triggered. Reflexes, habits, and emotional scripts operate efficiently, but they operate automatically. Awareness introduces a pause—a moment in which multiple responses become visible.</p>

  <p>That pause is where freedom enters. It is not unlimited freedom, but conditional freedom: the ability to select among available options rather than defaulting to the first impulse.</p>

  <span class="sidenote">
    <span class="sidenote-number"></span>
    <span class="sidenote-content">In this sense, awareness functions like a control surface rather than an engine.</span>
  </span>
</section>

<section id="degrees-of-freedom">
  <h2>Freedom as a Graded Capacity</h2>
  <p>Just as awareness exists on a spectrum, so does freedom. Individuals may possess high freedom in one domain (e.g., intellectual reasoning) while remaining constrained in others (e.g., emotional regulation or social behavior).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low-awareness states:</strong> action dominated by stimulus-response loops.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate-awareness states:</strong> deliberation within narrow frames.</li>
    <li><strong>High-awareness states:</strong> recognition of frames themselves and the ability to revise them.</li>
  </ul>

  <span class="sidenote">
    <span class="sidenote-number"></span>
    <span class="sidenote-content">This model aligns with developmental and situational views of agency.</span>
  </span>
</section>

<section id="costs-of-awareness">
  <h2>The Costs of Increased Freedom</h2>
  <p>Expanded awareness increases optionality, but it also increases cognitive load. More possible actions mean more responsibility for outcomes. As awareness grows, so does the burden of uncertainty.</p>

  <p>This helps explain why individuals and societies sometimes resist awareness: reduced freedom can feel safer. Automatic systems are psychologically efficient even when they are ethically brittle.</p>

  <details class="collapse">
    <summary>Common costs associated with higher awareness</summary>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Decision fatigue</li>
        <li>Heightened moral responsibility</li>
        <li>Reduced certainty and increased ambiguity</li>
        <li>Greater exposure to existential anxiety</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
</section>

<section id="control-vs-agency">
  <h2>Control, Agency, and Illusion</h2>
  <p>Meta-cognition can be misused as a tool for control. When awareness is employed to predict, manage, or eliminate uncertainty rather than engage with it, agency collapses into rigidity.</p>

  <p>True agency does not seek to eliminate uncertainty; it seeks to navigate it with clarity and restraint.</p>

  <span class="sidenote">
    <span class="sidenote-number"></span>
    <span class="sidenote-content">Control aims to fix outcomes; agency aims to remain responsive.</span>
  </span>
</section>

<section id="ethics-and-compassion">
  <h2>Ethical Implications</h2>
  <p>If freedom scales with awareness, then ethical responsibility must scale as well. However, this scaling is asymmetric: those with greater awareness bear more responsibility, not less.</p>

  <p>Compassion emerges as a stabilizing force in this system. It allows awareness to expand without isolating the individual from others operating at different levels of the spectrum.</p>
</section>

<section id="integration">
  <h2>Integration Rather Than Escape</h2>
  <p>The aim of meta-cognition is not transcendence from human limitation but integration within it. Freedom matures when awareness remains connected to embodiment, emotion, and relationship.</p>

  <p>In this sense, freedom is not an endpoint but an ongoing practice: the continual re-alignment of understanding and action.</p>
