  <p><span class="abstract-label">Abstract:</span> This entry sketches a custodial theory of secrecy: a small group treats certain information as too destabilizing for open circulation and assumes indefinite stewardship over access. The model does not require coordinated malice; it requires asymmetry, incentives, and an apparatus that defaults to classification. A satirical parable—plasmoids mistaken for angels—illustrates the moral hazard: when salvation is treated as a containment problem, scarcity becomes self-inflicted.</p>

<section id="orientation">
  <h2>Orientation</h2>
  <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ecrecy is often narrated as either (a) protection from panic or (b) protection of power. Both frames are incomplete. A more stable explanation is custodial: certain institutions adopt a standing presumption that some knowledge cannot be safely distributed and therefore must be governed through permanent access control.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">“Custodial” here is descriptive, not exculpatory. It names a posture: stewardship, risk aversion, and long-duration control of interfaces.</span></span></p>
  <p>This entry treats “anomalous phenomena” as a placeholder category. No factual claims about non-human intelligence are required. The question is institutional: what happens when an organization believes it has encountered something that is (i) uncertain, (ii) high-impact, and (iii) difficult to communicate without triggering misuse?</p>
</section>

<section id="custodial-secrecy">
  <h2>Custodial Secrecy</h2>
  <p><a href="definitions.html#custodial-secrecy" class="definition-link" data-term="Custodial Secrecy" data-definition="Stewardship logic that justifies indefinite restriction of knowledge access.">Custodial Secrecy</a> emerges when the costs of disclosure are imagined as unbounded and the costs of containment are treated as bounded. In that arithmetic, almost any uncertainty can be converted into a reason to wait.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> A small group sees more raw signal than outsiders (or believes it does).</li>
    <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Career, reputation, and mission alignment favor “no surprises.”</li>
    <li><strong>Path dependence:</strong> Once a category is classified, it becomes harder to unclassify than to continue classifying.</li>
    <li><strong>Interface control:</strong> Access becomes the product. Interpretation becomes the monopoly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Over time, custodial logic stops being an emergency measure and becomes an identity: not “we are hiding X,” but “we are the people qualified to hold X.”<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">This is how secrecy acquires a priesthood-like shape without requiring religion. The structure is the same: controlled access, sanctioned interpretation, and the promise of safety.</span></span></p>
</section>

<section id="interpretive-capture">
  <h2>Interpretive Capture</h2>
  <p>Custodial regimes do not only restrict facts; they restrict meaning. The easiest way to govern an unknown is to govern the narratives permitted to form around it. This is <a href="definitions.html#interpretive-capture" class="definition-link" data-term="Interpretive Capture" data-definition="When an institution monopolizes meaning-making about uncertain phenomena.">Interpretive Capture</a>.</p>
  <p>In practice, capture often looks banal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Redactions that remove the parameters required for independent analysis.</li>
    <li>Standardized language that converts irregular observations into approved categories.</li>
    <li>Briefings that emphasize uncertainty as a reason to delay rather than a reason to widen inquiry.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is not necessarily deception. It is frequently a conflict between two aims: preserving operational security and preserving an <a href="definitions.html#epistemic-commons" class="definition-link" data-term="Epistemic Commons" data-definition="Shared public space for evaluating claims with common evidence.">Epistemic Commons</a>. The custodial move prioritizes the former and treats the latter as optional.</p>
</section>

<section id="disclosure-gradients">
  <h2>Disclosure Gradients</h2>
  <p>Most controversies about “disclosure” are actually controversies about the correct gradient: what is revealed, to whom, under what constraints, with what supporting evidence, and with what institutional accountability.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">“All or nothing” is emotionally satisfying but operationally rare. Most real-world disclosures are partial, staged, and optimized for damage control.</span></span></p>
  <p>A custodial apparatus prefers gradients that preserve <a href="definitions.html#interface-risk" class="definition-link" data-term="Interface Risk" data-definition="The danger that access itself enables misuse, misinterpretation, or escalation.">Interface Risk</a> management. The public prefers gradients that preserve legitimacy and trust. The clash is predictable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Custodians:</strong> “We need control before we can talk.”</li>
    <li><strong>Public:</strong> “We need visibility before we can trust.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the gradient is mismatched, suspicion expands to fill the void. Secrecy becomes evidence of intent rather than a technique of governance.</p>
</section>

<section id="plasmoid-parable">
  <h2>The Plasmoid Parable</h2>
  <p>Consider a satirical premise: luminous plasmoids drift in the upper atmosphere and are routinely mistaken for angels. Each plasmoid, if studied, could power an entire continent for a decade. The tragedy is not scarcity; the tragedy is access control.</p>
  <p>In the parable, a committee classifies the phenomenon as an existential hazard. Their reasons vary—national security, reputational risk, fear of misuse—but the outcome is stable: the “angels” are quarantined as if salvation were contraband.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">Satire works here because it isolates a moral hazard: the institution tasked with protection can become the primary source of harm when protection hardens into indefinite withholding.</span></span></p>
  <p>The irony is sharp: as the global energy shortage intensifies, the symbol of relief in religious imagination literally descends from heaven, yet remains unavailable because a custodial class has mapped its own governance anxieties onto it. The object could be a battery; it becomes a sacrament. The result is preventable suffering.</p>
</section>

<section id="implications">
  <h2>Implications</h2>
  <p>The custodial model predicts several recurring features of classified-anomaly discourse:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Slow disclosure:</strong> not because nothing is known, but because knowledge is treated as a controlled interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative volatility:</strong> gaps in evidence invite maximal stories, both utopian and apocalyptic.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimacy drift:</strong> institutions lose credibility precisely when they claim to act for stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The corrective is not naive transparency. It is governance: auditable processes, bounded secrecy, and public-facing epistemic hygiene. The goal is to prevent <a href="definitions.html#custodial-overhang" class="definition-link" data-term="Custodial Overhang" data-definition="Residual secrecy justified by risk long after the original emergency passes.">Custodial Overhang</a>—the condition where yesterday’s caution becomes today’s unnecessary enclosure.</p>

  <details class="collapse">
    <summary>Speculative extensions</summary>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>If a program believed it was engaging with an intelligence outside ordinary frameworks, custodial logic would intensify: the fear would not be the phenomenon itself, but the downstream behavior of humans once access becomes competitive. In that regime, secrecy becomes a form of governance-by-denial: not “we solved it,” but “we prevent you from touching it.”</p>
      <p>This extension is a narrative affordance rather than a factual claim. Its usefulness is explanatory: it models why an institution might treat access as the most dangerous variable.</p>
