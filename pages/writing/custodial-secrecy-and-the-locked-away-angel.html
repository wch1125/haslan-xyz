                    <h2>Orientation</h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ecrecy is often narrated as either (a) protection from panic or (b) protection of power. The first frame imagines a fragile public that would disintegrate upon contact with certain truths—masses who can't handle complexity, populations that would riot or collapse or fall into chaos if they knew what the insiders know. The second frame imagines cynical elites who hide information to maintain advantage, who classify not for safety but for profit, who keep the public ignorant because ignorance is easier to govern. Both frames are incomplete. They capture real dynamics—there are fragile truths, there are cynical concealments—but they miss the structural logic that drives most secrecy regimes, the logic that operates even when no one intends to deceive and no one is especially fragile. A more stable explanation is custodial: certain institutions adopt a standing presumption that some knowledge cannot be safely distributed and therefore must be governed through permanent access control.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">"Custodial" here is descriptive, not exculpatory. It names a posture: stewardship, risk aversion, and long-duration control of interfaces. The custodian is not necessarily lying or malicious; they may genuinely believe they are protecting the public from itself. But the posture has structural effects that outlast any individual's intentions.</span></span></p>
                    <p>This entry treats "anomalous phenomena" as a placeholder category—a variable into which various specific concerns could be substituted. No factual claims about non-human intelligence are required; no position on UFOs or UAPs or any other contested matter is implied. The question is institutional: what happens when an organization believes it has encountered something that is (i) uncertain in its nature and implications, (ii) high-impact in its potential effects, and (iii) difficult to communicate without triggering misuse? The framework applies equally to advanced technology, to paradigm-shifting science, to politically destabilizing information, to anything that fits the pattern of "knowledge that might cause more harm distributed than concentrated." The specific content matters less than the structural response it triggers.</p>

                <section id="custodial-secrecy">
                    <h2>Custodial Secrecy</h2>
                    <p><a href="../definitions.html#custodial-secrecy" class="definition-link" data-term="Custodial Secrecy" data-definition="Stewardship logic that justifies indefinite restriction of knowledge access.">Custodial Secrecy</a> emerges when the costs of disclosure are imagined as unbounded and the costs of containment are treated as bounded. In that arithmetic—which is rarely made explicit, rarely subjected to scrutiny, rarely held up against alternatives—almost any uncertainty can be converted into a reason to wait. "We don't know enough to disclose safely" becomes perpetual, because there's always more we don't know, always another uncertainty that could justify another delay. The presumption of secrecy becomes default; the burden of proof falls entirely on disclosure.</p>
                    <p>Several structural factors reinforce this dynamic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> A small group sees more raw signal than outsiders (or believes it does). This asymmetry is self-reinforcing: those with access develop interpretive frameworks that those without access cannot evaluate. The gap between insider and outsider widens not just in information but in the capacity to process information, creating a sense—genuine or not—that outsiders simply couldn't understand what the insiders have seen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Career, reputation, and mission alignment favor "no surprises." The person who maintains classification faces no immediate cost; the person who discloses faces all the costs of whatever goes wrong downstream. The asymmetry of accountability creates asymmetry of behavior: it's always safer to stay quiet, always riskier to reveal. No one ever got fired for keeping a secret.</li>
                        <li><strong>Path dependence:</strong> Once a category is classified, it becomes harder to unclassify than to continue classifying. Each year of secrecy creates more precedent for secrecy; each layer of protection creates more stakeholders in protection; each generation of insiders inherits the assumption that secrecy was chosen for good reason without necessarily knowing what that reason was. The classification outlives its justification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interface control:</strong> Access becomes the product. Interpretation becomes the monopoly. The custodial class doesn't just hold information; it holds the frameworks through which information would be understood. Even if the raw facts were released, the interpretive context would remain classified—leaving outsiders with data they can't parse and conclusions they can't evaluate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Over time, custodial logic stops being an emergency measure and becomes an identity: not "we are hiding X," but "we are the people qualified to hold X." The secrecy becomes constitutive of the group's self-understanding, part of what makes them who they are. They are the keepers, the guardians, the responsible ones who bear the weight so others don't have to. This identity is deeply resistant to change because changing it would require not just releasing information but dissolving a self-concept.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">This is how secrecy acquires a priesthood-like shape without requiring religion. The structure is the same: controlled access, sanctioned interpretation, and the promise of safety in exchange for trust. The priests don't need to believe they are priests; they only need to believe they are responsible stewards, which amounts to the same functional role.</span></span></p>

                <section id="interpretive-capture">
                    <h2>Interpretive Capture</h2>
                    <p>Custodial regimes do not only restrict facts; they restrict meaning—and this is the deeper form of control, the one that persists even when facts leak, even when secrets are partially disclosed, even when the raw information reaches the public domain. The easiest way to govern an unknown is to govern the narratives permitted to form around it, to control not just what is seen but what the seeing means. This is <a href="../definitions.html#interpretive-capture" class="definition-link" data-term="Interpretive Capture" data-definition="When an institution monopolizes meaning-making about uncertain phenomena.">Interpretive Capture</a>.</p>
                    <p>In practice, capture often looks banal—not sinister men in dark rooms but ordinary bureaucratic process optimized for control:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Redaction that disables:</strong> Redactions that remove precisely the parameters required for independent analysis. The document is released, the transparency box is checked, but the information necessary to evaluate the claims is surgically excised. You can see that something happened; you cannot determine what it was or what it meant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Categorical domestication:</strong> Standardized language that converts irregular observations into approved categories. The anomalous becomes "unexplained aerial phenomena" becomes "sensor artifact" becomes nothing worth investigating. Each step in the linguistic chain reduces strangeness, makes the unusual fit existing frames, prevents the emergence of interpretations that would challenge the system's categories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uncertainty as closure:</strong> Briefings that emphasize uncertainty as a reason to delay rather than a reason to widen inquiry. "We don't know enough to say anything publicly" becomes permanent, because complete knowledge is the stated threshold for disclosure and complete knowledge is never achieved. Uncertainty, which should open investigation, instead closes it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is not necessarily deception in the sense of consciously lying—the officials implementing these procedures may genuinely believe they are being responsible, may genuinely believe that premature disclosure would cause harm, may genuinely believe that their caution is wisdom rather than capture. It is frequently a conflict between two aims: preserving operational security (which requires control) and preserving an <a href="../definitions.html#epistemic-commons" class="definition-link" data-term="Epistemic Commons" data-definition="Shared public space for evaluating claims with common evidence.">Epistemic Commons</a> (which requires accessibility). The custodial move prioritizes the former and treats the latter as optional, as a luxury for calmer times, as something that can be deferred indefinitely while security concerns remain—and security concerns always remain.</p>

                <section id="disclosure-gradients">
                    <h2>Disclosure Gradients</h2>
                    <p>Most controversies about "disclosure" are actually controversies about the correct gradient: not whether to reveal but what is revealed, to whom, under what constraints, with what supporting evidence, and with what institutional accountability. The binary framing—secret vs. public, classified vs. disclosed—obscures the real space of possibilities, which is a continuum of access levels, evidence quality, and interpretive context.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">"All or nothing" is emotionally satisfying but operationally rare. Most real-world disclosures are partial, staged, and optimized for damage control. The leaked document, the congressional briefing, the gradual drip of confirmations—these are gradient management, not binary state changes. The question is never "should we tell them?" but "how much, and how, and when?"</span></span></p>
                    <p>A custodial apparatus prefers gradients that preserve <a href="../definitions.html#interface-risk" class="definition-link" data-term="Interface Risk" data-definition="The danger that access itself enables misuse, misinterpretation, or escalation.">Interface Risk</a> management—that release information in forms the apparatus can still shape, that maintain interpretive control even as facts become public, that preserve the custodian's position as necessary intermediary between raw knowledge and public understanding. The public prefers gradients that preserve legitimacy and trust—that include enough evidence to evaluate claims independently, that provide sufficient context to form informed judgments, that respect the capacity of citizens to handle complexity. The clash is predictable and recurring:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Custodians:</strong> "We need control before we can talk. Let us manage the release, shape the narrative, prepare the context. Uncontrolled disclosure would cause panic, misuse, international incident, loss of advantage. Trust us to know what you can handle and when."</li>
                        <li><strong>Public:</strong> "We need visibility before we can trust. Your track record of deception, your conflicts of interest, your capture by institutional incentives—these make your assurances worthless. Show us the evidence, or we will assume the worst."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When the gradient is mismatched—when custodians release less than the public demands, or release it in forms that disable evaluation—suspicion expands to fill the void. Secrecy becomes evidence of intent rather than merely a technique of governance. The public begins to assume that what is hidden must be worse than what is revealed, that the very act of concealment implies guilt, that the custodians must be hiding something terrible precisely because they're trying so hard to hide. This suspicion may or may not be accurate, but it becomes self-fulfilling: the more the custodians refuse to disclose, the more the public believes there must be something worth concealing, and the more the custodians feel they cannot disclose because the public is now too suspicious to receive the information calmly.</p>

                <!-- NEW SECTION: Where the Model Fails -->
                <section id="model-limits">
                    <h2>Where This Model Fails</h2>
                    <p>The custodial model can explain almost any secrecy behavior, which is both its strength and its danger. A theory that explains everything explains nothing; a framework that can absorb any evidence becomes unfalsifiable, which is to say useless for distinguishing truth from fiction. A good institutional theory risks becoming narrative solvent—able to dissolve any contrary evidence into the frame, able to interpret any disclosure as "gradient management" and any transparency as "controlled release."</p>
                    <p>To keep this model honest—to prevent it from collapsing into the very interpretive capture it describes—consider cases where it would be falsified or significantly weakened:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Voluntary relinquishment:</strong> If institutions regularly give up interpretive control once risks diminish, custodial logic is not the dominant driver. The model predicts that secrecy tends to persist beyond its original justification, that custodians find new reasons to maintain control as old reasons expire. If this is wrong—if we observe institutions setting clear declassification schedules and actually honoring them, releasing information when predetermined conditions are met, voluntarily surrendering control they could have maintained—then the model overestimates institutional capture. (Current evidence: this is rare, but it happens. FOIA releases eventually occur; declassification happens after decades; whistleblower protections occasionally work. The model is not entirely wrong, but it may exaggerate the stickiness of custodial identity.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Disclosure without institutional benefit:</strong> If disclosure occurs that damages institutional interests without any external pressure forcing the release—if custodians sometimes choose transparency even when it costs them, even when they could have maintained secrecy—then the model's emphasis on incentives is weakened. The model predicts that disclosure happens only when the costs of continued secrecy exceed the costs of revelation, when maintaining the secret becomes more dangerous than releasing it. If disclosure sometimes happens for other reasons—conscience, principle, simple recognition that the public deserves to know—then the model is too cynical.</li>
                        <li><strong>Successful bounded secrecy:</strong> If secrecy regimes successfully self-terminate according to pre-established criteria—if an institution can say "we will reveal X when conditions Y are met" and then actually reveal X when Y is met—then "custodial overhang" is not inevitable, just common. The model predicts that justifications evolve to match challenges, that thresholds for disclosure shift as disclosure approaches, that secrecy finds ways to perpetuate itself. If this is wrong—if bounded secrecy is achievable with appropriate institutional design—then the model is more pessimistic than warranted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The model is most useful when applied to cases of <em>indefinite</em> secrecy with <em>adaptive</em> justification—where the reasons for classification evolve to match challenges rather than expiring with original conditions, where each new objection to secrecy generates a new reason to maintain it, where the endpoint keeps receding as you approach. In those cases, custodial logic provides genuine explanatory power. In cases of bounded, principled secrecy with clear declassification criteria, the model may be less relevant.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="plasmoid-parable">
                    <h2>The Plasmoid Parable</h2>
                    <p>Consider a satirical premise, useful not as a factual claim but as a thought experiment that isolates the moral logic at stake: luminous plasmoids drift in the upper atmosphere and are routinely mistaken for angels. They glow with shifting colors; they appear and disappear without apparent cause; they have been observed since antiquity and feature in religious art across cultures. Each plasmoid, if properly studied and harnessed, could power an entire continent for a decade—clean energy, abundant, freely available, waiting in the sky like manna. The tragedy is not scarcity; the tragedy is access control.</p>
                    <p>In the parable, a committee classifies the phenomenon as an existential hazard. Their reasons vary—national security (what if adversaries learn to harness them first?), reputational risk (what if we're wrong about their benevolence?), fear of misuse (what if bad actors weaponize the energy?), preservation of existing economic structures (what if free energy destabilizes markets?)—but the outcome is stable: the "angels" are quarantined as if salvation were contraband. The committee genuinely believes it is being responsible. The committee genuinely believes the public cannot handle the truth. The committee has convinced itself that indefinite secrecy is a form of care.<span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote-content">Satire works here because it isolates a moral hazard: the institution tasked with protection can become the primary source of harm when protection hardens into indefinite withholding. The committee set up to manage the plasmoid phenomenon becomes, over time, the main reason the phenomenon remains unmanaged. The cure becomes the disease; the guardian becomes the obstacle.</span></span></p>
                    <p>The irony is sharp and intended to sting: as the global energy shortage intensifies—as climate change accelerates, as wars are fought over fossil fuels, as billions suffer from energy poverty—the symbol of relief in religious imagination literally descends from heaven, yet remains unavailable because a custodial class has mapped its own governance anxieties onto it. The object could be a battery; it becomes a sacrament. The thing that could solve the problem becomes the thing that must be protected from those who have the problem. The result is preventable suffering, vast in scale, justified by appeals to security that the public cannot evaluate because the evidence is classified.</p>
                    <p>The parable is not subtle, and it's not meant to be. It draws the custodial logic to its absurd conclusion to make visible what more moderate versions obscure. In less extreme form, the same pattern operates wherever institutions decide that the public is not ready for knowledge that could help them—wherever custodians substitute their own judgment for collective deliberation, wherever "we can't tell them" becomes permanent policy rather than temporary expedient. The angels stay locked away, and the lockkeepers congratulate themselves on their prudence.</p>

                <section id="implications">
                    <h2>Implications</h2>
                    <p>The custodial model, if accurate, predicts several recurring features of classified-anomaly discourse—and these predictions can be tested against observed patterns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Slow disclosure:</strong> Not because nothing is known, but because knowledge is treated as a controlled interface. The drip-drip-drip of partial revelations, the carefully managed leaks, the gradual normalization of previously outlandish claims—these are not accidental or organic but managed. The timeline serves the custodians' need to maintain interpretive control, not the public's need to know. Each disclosure is calibrated to release pressure without surrendering authority.</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrative volatility:</strong> Gaps in evidence invite maximal stories, both utopian and apocalyptic. When the public knows that something is being hidden but not what, imagination fills the void. Some imagine saviors; others imagine demons; few imagine the mundane bureaucratic reality of committees managing unknowns. The custodians' secrecy creates the very instability they claim to be preventing, as speculation rushes in to fill the space that evidence would have occupied.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimacy drift:</strong> Institutions lose credibility precisely when they claim to act for stability. Each discovery of previous deception, each revelation that officials lied or misled, each proof that the cover story was a cover story—these compound into general distrust. The custodians' own behavior creates the conditions that make disclosure harder, as the public becomes less willing to accept official interpretations of anything. Trust, once broken, rebuilds slowly if at all.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The corrective is not naive transparency—not the fantasy that all secrets can or should be immediately revealed, not the position that information wants to be free and institutions are always wrong to restrict it. Some secrets may genuinely require protection; some disclosures may genuinely cause harm; some gradient management may be legitimately necessary. The corrective is governance: auditable processes that create accountability, bounded secrecy with clear declassification criteria, and public-facing epistemic hygiene that maintains trust through demonstrated honesty even when full disclosure is not possible. The goal is to prevent <a href="../definitions.html#custodial-overhang" class="definition-link" data-term="Custodial Overhang" data-definition="Residual secrecy justified by risk long after the original emergency passes.">Custodial Overhang</a>—the condition where yesterday's caution becomes today's unnecessary enclosure, where temporary protection becomes permanent prohibition, where the apparatus built to manage a crisis outlives the crisis and becomes a crisis of its own.</p>

                        <div class="collapse-content">
                            <p>If a program believed it was engaging with an intelligence outside ordinary frameworks—genuinely non-human, genuinely anomalous, genuinely beyond existing categories—custodial logic would intensify beyond anything discussed above. The fear would not be the phenomenon itself, would not be alien invasion or technological threat in any simple sense. The fear would be the downstream behavior of humans once access becomes competitive: the race to control, the weaponization, the religious fervor, the economic disruption, the collapse of frameworks that organize social life. In that regime, secrecy becomes a form of governance-by-denial: not "we solved it," not "we understand it," but "we prevent you from touching it, because the touching itself is the danger."</p>

If you imagine the custodians as facing not just uncertainty but category-breaking uncertainty, their behavior becomes more comprehensible even as it remains objectionable. The locked-away angel is locked away not because it's dangerous but because we are.</p>
